# CRPG Camera: Introduction and Overview
## What is CRPG Camera?
CRPG Camera is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that offers an easy, modern and visually appealing solution for those looking to incorporate a 3D isometric camera into their projects. 

Put another way, it's a "works-out-of-the-box" solution for making your camera behave like the ones in Baldur's Gate 3, Divinity Original Sin 2 and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. Useful for CRPGs, strategy games, and more.

## Why CRPG Camera? 
CRPG Camera is for those looking to implement a smooth, modern and professional 3D isometric camera into their projects. The inspiration and closest thing is the camera from Baldur's Gate 3. It's especially useful for CRPGs, strategy games, top-down adventures, and potentially a wide variety of similar projects.  

Core features include: 
1. Smooth camera movement 
2. Automatic "stepping up and down" to account for terrain height 
3. The ability to switch back and forth between following a specific actor and moving the camera freely 
4. The ability to smoothly zoom the camera in and out
5. The optional ability to tilt the camera based on the current zoom value using a custom curve
6. Easy to use with an extremely simple set of blueprint functions
