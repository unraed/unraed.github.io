## Introduction 
This is a very brief tutorial for the first significant new feature that has been added to the plugin: the addition of a minimum play time property for speech nodes. 

## How it Works
Previously, the play time for an individual speech in dialogue was tied exclusively to its audio content. If no audio content was provided, the speech's duration would be instant. 

The minimum play time option allows you to add a bit more nuance to how long it takes your speeches to play. Its behavior is as follows:

- If there is no audio content, the minimum play time will be the duration in seconds that the speech takes to play. 
- If the speech's audio clip is longer than the minimum play time in seconds, the length of the speech's audio clip will be the duration that the speech takes to play. 
- If the speech's audio clip is shorter than the minimum play time in seconds, the minimum play time will be the duration that the speech takes to play. 

## Conclusion
And that is all there is to it. Minimum play time is a simple but extremely versatile feature that allows you to create and manage your dialogues more effectively.
